<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Portable X-Ray Flat Panel Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Conversion</li><li>Indirect Conversion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Portable X-Ray Flat Panel Detector market is typically divided into two main types: direct conversion and indirect conversion. Direct conversion detectors use materials that convert X-ray photons directly into electrical signals, offering high image quality and faster processing times. In contrast, indirect conversion detectors utilize a two-step process, first converting X-ray photons into visible light, which is then transformed into electrical signals. While indirect conversion tends to be more cost-effective, direct conversion provides superior resolution and efficiency, making each suited for different applications.</p></p>
